# Overwolf sample app

This repository contains a sample app that demonstrates some basic points and flows that are relevant when developing Overwolf apps:

- The app will launch automatically when Fortnite starts
- Register to the overwolf.games.events API in order to receive real time events from the game.
- Define a custom hotkey to be used in-game
- Communication between the app windows according to our best practices 

## How to load the app
Under Overwolf's settings, choose Support tab and then Development options. Click the Load unpacked button and choose the native folder of this repository.

## Notes
Editing the author or app name in the manifest will prevent loading the app
as unpacked app.
